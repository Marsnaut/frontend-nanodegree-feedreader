# Project Overview

This project demonstrates browser based testing using [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/). It helps with Test Driven Development (TDD) by thinking about the application's expected behavior.


## Steps to successfully run this application

Start by doing `npm install` as you might need [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery) depending on what node modules you have installed globally.

Open the `index.html` file in any browser to load the file. The test specs should appear at the bottom of the page once loaded. The tests will automatically be executed and any passed or failed tests will be shown. If there are any errors, the stack trace will display.
